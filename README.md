# Lyra-Issues-Tracker
This is our public facing repo for Lyra and issues tracking.

When you log an issue here we are more likely to see the issue and work on it rather then our discord server.

When logging your issue it is important that you do the following:
1. Steps to reproduce
2. What you expect to happen
3. What actaully happens EG: error thrown.
